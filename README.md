## Welcome to my Blog

I use this site to share my strategy on developing applications or components related to my current interests.

Ruby and Ruby on Rails are a part of my day to day development activities.

### Notable Shares
* [SknServices](https://skoona.github.io/SknServices/)
* * [SknServices Demo](http://vserv.skoona.net:8080/)
* [SknUtils](https://skoona.github.io/skn_utils/)
* [Gtk3 BarGraph](https://skoona.github.io/glinegraph-cairo/)
* [Gtk3 Rpi Utilities](https://skoona.github.io/skn_rpi-display-services/)

### Existing Blog Site with Ruby and Gtk3 explorations.
* [Alternate development strategy for building Rails applications.](https://skoona.blogspot.com/2016/08/sknservices-alternate-development_11.html)
* [Using UDP for a Raspberry Pi Display and locator service.](https://skoona.blogspot.com/2016/08/raspberry-pi-iot-udp-programming-with.html)

I will be posting new articles that go in depth on the above strategy, here!
