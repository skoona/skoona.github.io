<h1>Welcome to my Blog</h1>

<p>I use this site to share my strategy for developing applications or components related to my current interests.</p>

<p>Recently I've been working through issues related to using Domain Driven Design with Rails version 4.2 and higher.  The 
	legacy application under consideration was built using the SknStragey, which I would like to upgrade to include more DDD factors.</p>

<p><a href="https://skoona.github.io/SknServices/">SknServices</a> is the application I'd like to share as an example for others.  SknServices 
	is a public demonstration application which will be reflective of the methods and strategy used in my corporate application.</p>
