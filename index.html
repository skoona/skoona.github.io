<h1>BEGIN</h1>


<p>
    I use this site to share my strategy for developing applications or components related to my current interests.
    Authentication, Authorization, Domain Driven Design, JRuby, Java, Integration,
    Raspberry Pi and Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Apache Camel, Middleware,
    Queueing, and Open Source are some of the topics I am personally invested in learning more about.
</p>

<p>Recently I've been working through issues related to using Domain Driven Design with Rails version 4.2 and higher.  The 
	legacy application under consideration was built using the SknStragey, which I would like to upgrade to include more DDD factors.</p>

<p><a href="https://skoona.github.io/SknServices/">SknServices</a> is the application I'd like to share as an example for others.  SknServices 
	is a public demonstration application which will be reflective of the methods and strategy used in my corporate application.</p>
