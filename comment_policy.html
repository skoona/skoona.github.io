    <h2>Keep it civil!</h2>

    <p>We’re going to get into the thick of a lot of heated discussions and that’s okay. These discussions often entail topics that we all personally care a lot about and will passionately defend. But in order for discussions to thrive here, we need to remember to criticize ideas, not people.</p>

    <p>Comments that we find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing may be removed. If you don’t have something nice to say about another user, don't say it. Treat others the way you’d like to be treated.
        Always strive to add value to every interaction and discussion you participate in.</p>

    <p>There are a lot of discussions that happen every day on Disqus. Before joining in a discussion, browse through some of the most recent and active discussions happening in the community, especially if you’re new there.</p>

    <p>If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.</p>
